Everyone who's gone through a computer science undergrad has studied these topics. We use at least some of the data structure we learned back then on a daily basis.. lists, queues, stacks, and graphs (to name a few).

However, a lot of programmers will tell you that they rarely use the algorithms they were taught: merge sort, breadth-first search, binary search trees, etc.. I would be one of those. I believe the number of times I've written one of these or a recursive algorithm in general during a professional project is probably < 6 times throughout my entire ~10 year career. 

That said! I've just completed a pretty thorough review of these computer science fundamentals and I've been asking myself if I would have used them more in the past 10 years had they stayed fresher in my mind. And would my code have been better? I can't answer that for sure, however I do now believe that revisiting these fundamentals from time to time is not only fun (it really is!)... but keeps you sharp.

One thing has changed since I learned these concepts in college, however. I'm 10 years older... I've written a lot of varied algorithms during that time.. and I have a lot more real world context to apply to my understanding of these. I think I understand them better this time around. (Though I'm still no expert.)

I want to capture and document that understanding in the hopes of improving it and this blog series will do that. My outline for what will be covered is as follows:

1. Data Structures Review
2. Algorithms - Problem Types
3. Algorithms - Recursion vs. Iterative
4. Lists - Problem to Solution Mapping
5. Graphs - Problem to Solution Mapping
6. Asymptotic Analysis

Links from this list will be updated as the posts get completed!
