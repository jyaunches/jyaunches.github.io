<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I had the opportunity to put a presentation together for the Brooklyn iOS meetup recently and decided to do one based on 'Lessons Learned' from a self-taught stand point. I am an iOS developer largely self-taught and many things I learned along the way, I wish I had known earlier!<br /><br />I think the meet-up has a range of people from lots of different experience levels and I wanted to engage all of them to also talk about what they've learned that they wish they knew earlier.<br /><br />It went in a really cool direction with a lot of discussion around the tools people use. A lot of a developers power is in the tools they use and it seems like the iOS space is exploding with new and awesome tools to help you write apps more efficiently.<br /><br />Here's the video of the presentation.<br /><br /></div><iframe frameborder="0" height="360" scrolling="no" src="http://new.livestream.com/accounts/646193/events/2408745/videos/30290628/player?autoPlay=false&amp;height=360&amp;mute=false&amp;width=640" width="640"></iframe><br /><br />Also, a lot of tools were mentioned by audience members in the discussion following the presentation.. I'll mention here some of the tools I discussed and those mentioned by others:<br /><br /><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Mentioned in presentation:<br /><br />PaintCode, CocoaPods, AFNetworking, HockeyApp, TestFlight, RestKit(verdict: avoid), and MagicalRecord.</div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />Mentioned in discussion:<br /><br />iExplorer, Reveal, ImageOptim, Crashlytics, Pop, and Envision.</div></div>
