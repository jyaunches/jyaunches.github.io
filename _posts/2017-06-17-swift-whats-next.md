Like many iOS engineers, I learned how to build iPhone apps using Objective C. I also muttered the same frustrations... 'What are these silly brackets?' 'Wha? I have to create header files?' 'I have to manage my own memory??' -> 'Ok, fine. It's not the worst, but does add a layer of understanding which I have to go out and get.'

Apple began creating the Swift programming language for many of these complaints. And others.

To name a few.


In 2010 LLVM reached a point where it could support more features than could be added to Objective C. Chris Lattner (behind LLBM & Swift) began working on Swift at this point.

Apple's free iBook on Swift also notes that "Swift has been years in the making," adding that "Apple laid the foundation for Swift by advancing our existing compiler, debugger, and framework infrastructure. 

"We simplified memory management with Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). Our framework stack, built on the solid base of Foundation and Cocoa, has been modernized and standardized throughout. Objective-C itself has evolved to support blocks, collection literals, and modules, enabling framework adoption of modern language technologies without disruption. Thanks to this groundwork, we can now introduce a new language for the future of Apple software development."

1. Crashes.

2. New developer ramp up.
 - Playgrounds
 - Syntax

 "Playgrounds were heavily influenced by Bret Victor's ideas [which are cited as a inspiration for Khan Academy's online environment for learning to program], by Light Table [an open source IDE designed to provide realtime feedback about code and how programs work] and by many other interactive systems. 

 - Chris Lattner

 Apple is committed to changing the game here. Playgrounds has come far is now available on iPad.

3. Language perks. Generics.
