<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Rejection feels horrible doesn't it? It feels even worse when you could have avoided it so easily!<br /><br />I submitted my first iOS app, GoFest, to iTunes Connect last week and just got notice back yesterday that it's been rejected because of it's metadata. What does this mean? Well, in my particular case, it's because I submitted my 4" retina screenshots were taken on a device running iOS 7. Doh! The app itself targets iOS 6, but because the phone I took the screenshots on was running iOS 7, they're not accepted.<br /><br />I wish I had lots of devices around running all the various iOS versions available.. but alas, I do not. So, retake the screenshots. Resubmit.&nbsp;</div>
