It's a common thing, as software engineers, to have a tendency to shy away from understanding compilation. At a high level, you know the compiler is turning your code into machine code the target computer (running your program) can execute. However, it's a powerful thing to understand compilation at a deeper level.

Specifically as a Swift developer, it's fascinating to know that without the earlier development of Swift's compiler, the LLVM.. the language itself likely wouldn't have been developed.

This article will look at what [the LLVM](https://llvm.org/) is and the history of it's development and adoption by Apple. 

## What is the LLVM

LLVM is an umbrella project for many subprojects. All of which result in a compiler infrastructure and tool chain used today largely by developers using C/C++ based languages and which is heavily integrated in Xcode and it's compilation process.

### A Compilation Tool Chain

Any set of compilation tools (such as the LLVM and it's sub-projects) follow a similar flow for compiling source code to machine code and then handing the result off to a process for linking and generating an executable.

### The LLVM Pieces

_Frontend_

* Conversion of source code to an intermediary language (IR)
* Clang - Developed to be LLVM's go-to frontend compiler.. including support for Obj-C. This allowed Objective-C to be be progressed beyond what was possible with gcc.
* [Swift compiler](https://swift.org/compiler-stdlib/)

_Optimizations_

* One of the things that sets the LLVM compilation toolset apart. It's optimizations slowly developed over the years and have allowed many LLVM use cases to surpass gcc in speed and other benchmarks.

_Development feedback tools_

* LLDB is a great example here. These exist outside the compilation flow.. but often build on the same tools. LLDB uses the source code analysis in Clang to provide a great native debugger.

_Backend_

* After the front-end has converted the source language to LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) code, this is handed off to the LLVM optimizer. Following optimization, the LLVM backend performs target-independent code generation that is capable of creating output for several types of target CPUs â€” including X86, PowerPC, ARM, and SPARC.
* This is likely a strong reason for Apple's support and adoption.

_Linking tools_

* Won't go into these too much for LLVM. Just know that linking is one of the last stages of 'building'. It does happen post compilation and will usually raise errors if you've got duplicate definitions across multiple source code files.

### Where the Power is

Most compilation toolchains, including gcc, break things into a front-end, middle section and back-end. This brings great flexibility. LLVM went further in terms of modularity and reuseablity.

- If you want support for a new language, you write a front-end lexer to convert you source language to LLVM IR code.
- If you need speed given a certain source code size, you could incorporate a new optimizer.
- If you need your code to run a specific target architecture not supported you could [write your 
own backend](https://llvm.org/docs/WritingAnLLVMBackend.html)
- Many of the LLVM projects can also be plugged into GCC.

## Apple & LLVM History

The LLVM compiler project was not started at Apple but University of Illinois by Chris Lattner (that guy) and a professor there, Vikram Adve. 

It was originally implemented to compile C & C++, but was created with a 'language-agnostic' design in mind... this caught the eye of Apple they brought Lattner, his project and it's development in-house in 2005. Though it appears it was not immediately invested in, Lattner spent his own time advancing the project until he was able to demonstrate it's value and convince Apple to invest a team in it. It was further advanced and over time became integral to Apple's development toolset... slowly replacing the previously used GCC compiler and many of the low-level tools Apple used across it's development.

The benefits brought by the LLVM allowed Apple to progress Objective C and Xcode and much of the performance and potential of their low-level tools.

In 2010, it seems the LLVM reached a point where it could support more features than could be added to Objective C. Lattner apparently began working on Swift at this point. The framework laid by the advancements to the LLVM, Obj-C and Apple toolset seem to have been foundational in the direction Swift would go.

"We simplified memory management with Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). Our framework stack, built on the solid base of Foundation and Cocoa, has been modernized and standardized throughout. Objective-C itself has evolved to support blocks, collection literals, and modules, enabling framework adoption of modern language technologies without disruption. Thanks to this groundwork, we can now introduce a new language for the future of Apple software development."

## Conclusion

This article should have given a good idea of the LLVM specifically around:
* What the it is from a high level
* What it's most fundamental modular projects are
* Why, how and when Apple adopted it
* Where it's power lies

One interesting next step in learning about the LLVM and it's use would be to look at how the Swift front-end compiler was developed and how it fits into the LLVM toolchain. Fun!
