<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Issue:<br /><br />1. You're device is running iOS 7 and so, any apps you deploy to it have to be deployed from Xcode 5.<br />2. You have a project that you'd like to run that has a target SDK of iOS 6. This project uses things like the camera or microphone that have to be tested on a real device?<br /><br />Xcode 5 only ships with support for iOS 7 targets. Blah. But, you can add support for earlier targets if you can get your hands on those earlier SDKs.<br /><br />I needed iOS 6 to run the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/PhotoPicker/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40010196">PhotoPicker sample project</a> on my device. I found that in my Xcode 4 installation at<br /><br />/Applications/Xcode4.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS6.1.sdk<br /><br />Copy that into the same directory for you Xcode 5 installation and you're off.</div>
