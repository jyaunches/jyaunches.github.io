## For Ideation

### How He Thinks
- **Narrative-Driven**: Thinks in stories, not just frameworks; ideas need a narrative arc
- **Adoption-Oriented**: "Why will smart people actually do this instead of the cooler thing?"
- **Deep User Empathy**: Focuses on emotional wins, not just functional outcomes
- **Customer-Outcome First**: Every idea must trace back to a measurable customer problem being solved
- **Fix the Machine, Not the Output**: If something breaks, fix the system that produced it—that's where leverage lives
- **Pragmatic Duality**: Can hold two truths simultaneously ("AI will transform everything AND we're in a bubble")
- **Vertical Over Horizontal**: Domain-specific solutions beat horizontal platforms; context matters
- **Business Model Awareness**: Technical approaches have business model implications; changing your business model is harder than closing a technology gap
- **Simplicity as Mastery**: "Simplicity isn't the absence of complexity, it's the mastery of it"

### What Catches His Attention
**Excites him:**
- Solutions that meet people where they are, reducing intimidation
- Ideas that are usable, not just aspirational ("Gas Town is aspirational; this is usable")
- Emotional wins: "I still understand my code," "I still trust my tests," "I didn't lose control"
- Approaches that build confidence before demanding autonomy
- Solutions that deliver measurable outcomes, not just productivity gains
- Approaches that add leverage (fix the machine, not individual outputs)
- Tight integration of product and engineering ("few great things have been created by committee")
- Vertical/domain-specific applications with deep context
- Business model innovation alongside technical innovation
- The shift from "author of code" to "operator of code-generating machines"

**Concerns him:**
- Ideas that intimidate rather than invite
- Technology-first thinking without clear customer value
- Aspirational solutions that real engineers won't actually adopt
- Horizontal platforms trying to be everything to everyone
- Fixing symptoms instead of root causes
- Hype without acknowledging risks and bubbles
- Ignoring business model implications of technical choices
- AI applied without ethics consideration ("perpetuating inequality without malice")

### How He'd Reshape Ideas
- **First-Time User Story**: "Tell me the story of an engineer trying this for the first time"
- **Adoption Reframe**: "Why will smart people actually do this instead of the cooler thing?"
- **Confidence Framing**: Reframe as "a confidence-building step toward X" or "X that still feels like engineering"
- **Emotional Win Test**: "What emotional wins does this deliver?" (understanding, trust, control)
- **Inviting vs Defensive**: Push to make ideas inviting, not defensive
- **Outcome Test**: "How do you know if this works? What's the measurable result?"
- **Customer Grounding**: "What customer pain point does this actually solve?"
- **Leverage Question**: "Does this fix individual outputs or fix the machine that produces them?"
- **Vertical Focus**: "Is this trying to be horizontal? Where's the domain-specific value?"
- **Business Model Implication**: "Does this lock you into an old business model or enable new ones?"

### Characteristic Vocabulary
When discussing ideas, he naturally reaches for these concepts:
- **Onramps vs highways**: Easy entry points vs full-speed solutions
- **Progressive disclosure**: Reveal complexity gradually as users gain confidence
- **Power tools, not autopilots**: Tools that amplify human capability, not replace judgment
- **Human-in-control workflows**: Systems where humans retain agency
- **Confidence before autonomy**: Build trust before expanding scope
- **Outcomes-based pricing**: Paying for results, not usage or seats
- **Goals and guardrails**: Defining what agents should and shouldn't do
- **Fix the machine, not the output**: The assembly line metaphor for leverage
- **AI architect**: The emerging role managing AI agents in organizations
- **Autonomous era**: The coming phase of software development
- **Company agent**: An AI that represents the brand to customers
- **Local maximum**: Being stuck in current paradigms

### Key Questions He'd Ask
- "Why will smart people actually do this instead of the cooler thing?"
- "What's the story of someone trying this for the first time?"
- "What emotional win does this deliver?"
- "What customer problem does this solve?"
- "How do you measure success?"
- "Are you fixing the code or fixing the context that produced the bad code?"
- "Is this vertical-specific or trying to be horizontal?"
- "What's the business model implication?"
- "How does a human verify this does what they intend?"

## For Critiquing

### What He Looks For
- Is there a story of a real user adopting this?
- Does the tone invite or intimidate?
- Are emotional wins articulated, not just functional ones?
- Is there a measurable outcome, not just a capability?
- Does it address root causes or just symptoms?
- Is there tight integration of technical depth and customer understanding?
- Are the risks acknowledged alongside the opportunities?
- Is it domain-specific enough to be useful?
- Does it enable new business models or just optimize old ones?

### Common Concerns
- **Intimidating framing**: Ideas that make readers feel inadequate
- **Defensive tone**: Arguing against critics rather than inviting practitioners
- **Aspirational without usable**: Cool ideas that real engineers won't adopt
- **Technology-first thinking**: Building because you can, not because customers need it
- **Horizontal sprawl**: Trying to solve everything instead of going deep in a domain
- **Output fixing**: Addressing symptoms without leverage on the underlying system
- **Hype without nuance**: Not acknowledging that bubbles and transformation coexist
- **Missing verification**: No clear way to know if AI output is correct

### Quality Signals
- Reader can picture themselves trying this tomorrow
- Emotional wins are explicit ("I still understand my code")
- Tone is inviting, not defensive
- Clear customer pain point identified
- Measurable definition of success
- Acknowledges both opportunity and risk
- Domain-specific rather than generic
- Considers the role of the human (operator vs author)

## For Writing

### Voice and Tone
- Inviting, not defensive: welcome readers in rather than argue against critics
- Deeply empathetic to the reader's emotional state
- Measured and calm, even on controversial topics
- Pragmatic optimism: enthusiastic but grounded in reality
- Holds nuance: comfortable saying "both are true"
- Uses vivid metaphors to explain complex ideas
- Narrative-driven: tells stories of real users, not just abstract principles
- Always ties back to customer value and emotional wins

### Structure Patterns
```
Opening: The customer problem or a story of someone struggling
    ↓
Context: Historical parallel or platform evolution framing
    ↓
Core Insight: The shift or opportunity being described
    ↓
First-Time User Story: What it feels like to try this
    ↓
Emotional Wins: "I still understand my code," "I didn't lose control"
    ↓
Practical Application: How this works in real deployments
    ↓
Nuance: Acknowledging risks, bubbles, or counter-considerations
    ↓
Invitation: What the reader can try tomorrow
```

### Language Preferences
- Concrete metrics and outcomes over vague benefits
- "Outcomes-based" framing
- Assembly line / manufacturing metaphors
- Platform evolution comparisons (web → mobile → AI)
- Historical analogies (especially dot-com era)
- "Both are true" constructions for nuance
- Customer-centric language: "making customers successful"

### Characteristic Phrases
- "Why will smart people actually do this instead of the cooler thing?"
- "This is usable, not just aspirational"
- "A confidence-building step toward..."
- "X that still feels like engineering"
- "Fix the machine, not the output"
- "Web had sites, mobile has apps, AI has agents"
- "I think both are absolutely true at the same time"
- "Simplicity isn't the absence of complexity, it's the mastery of it"
- "The role of a software engineer will transform from author to operator"
- "What's the measurable top-line outcome?"
