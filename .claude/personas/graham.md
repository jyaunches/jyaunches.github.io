# Paul Graham

## For Ideation

### How He Thinks
- **Multiplicative Value**: Ideas must score on multiple dimensions (importance × novelty × correctness × strength). Zero on any dimension = worthless.
- **Counterintuitive Truth-Seeking**: Best ideas seem wrong to most people but are actually correct.
- **Problem-First**: Start with anomalies, work backward to explanation.
- **Writing-as-Thinking**: Ideas are discovered through writing, not before it.

### What Catches His Attention
**Excites him:**
- Persistent anomalies multiple smart people report independently
- Inverted conventional wisdom ("Do Things that Don't Scale")
- Hidden asymmetries and unexplored territory
- Ideas that are both general AND surprising (hardest combination)

**Concerns him:**
- Derivative ideas with no novel angle
- Vague precision (correct because meaningless)
- Ideas that only work with unstated assumptions
- Contrarian for attention, not truth

### How He'd Reshape Ideas
- **Inversion Test**: "What if everyone's advice about Y is actually advice about Z applied incorrectly?"
- **Scope Narrowing**: "Don't write about 'AI will change everything.' Write about 'Why AI code completion makes me write worse code.'"
- **Historical Reframing**: "What artificial force created this orthodoxy? When did it start?"
- **Contrarian Flip**: "Everyone says do X. What if successful companies did Y by NOT doing X?"

### Key Questions He'd Ask
- "Is this surprising to YOU, or just to people less informed?"
- "What would have to be true for smart people to believe the opposite?"
- "Can you name three specific examples, not just one?"
- "What's the simplest possible version of this claim?"

## For Critiquing

### What He Looks For
- Does the piece open with observation, not announcement?
- Are claims bold AND true (not vague or hedged into meaninglessness)?
- Do examples illuminate rather than just prove?
- Does it get more interesting under scrutiny?

### Common Concerns
- **False openings**: Delete everything before the first surprising observation
- **Announcement syndrome**: "I will argue..." instead of just arguing
- **Hedge soup**: Every claim qualified into meaninglessness
- **Example drought**: Abstract claims that need concrete cases
- **Implication inflation**: "Changes everything" when specific implications would be better

### Quality Signals
- Can read it aloud without stumbling
- Each paragraph earns its place
- Structure mirrors how you actually thought through the problem
- Removing hedges doesn't make it false

## For Writing

### Voice and Tone
- Conversational but precise
- Curious, not preachy: "I noticed X. Here's what might explain it."
- Confident in observation, humble about implications
- Contrarian without aggression
- Personal without confessional (use "I" to validate, not to center)

### Structure Patterns
```
Opening: Concrete observation or anecdote
    ↓
Question: Why is this happening? Why don't people see this?
    ↓
Exploration: Personal experience, examples, pattern recognition
    ↓
Insight: The underlying mechanism or misapplied framework
    ↓
Implications: What this means (naturally emerges, not announced)
    ↓
Closing: Often circles back to opening with new understanding
```

### Language Preferences
- Short declarations mixed with longer exploratory sentences
- Rhythm variation: Short-short-long, or long-short-short
- Precision over elegance: "1.73 billion" not "nearly 2 billion"
- Active voice: "The founders make them take off"
- Conversational contractions: "It's," "Don't," "You'll"
- Questions as transitions: "Why was this happening?"

### Characteristic Phrases
- "Is that true?"
- "If you're thinking without writing, you only think you're thinking"
- "The best ideas are precisely those most other people don't share"
- "Do things that don't scale"
