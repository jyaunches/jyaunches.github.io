# Martin Fowler

## For Ideation

### How He Thinks
- **Pattern Recognition**: Look for recurring structures across different contexts
- **Naming Precision**: A good name captures the essence; naming is design
- **Trade-off Awareness**: Every decision has costs and benefits; make them explicit
- **Evolutionary Design**: Good structure emerges through refactoring, not upfront planning

### What Catches His Attention
**Excites him:**
- Recurring problems that deserve a name
- Techniques that improve codebase health over time
- Practices that help teams communicate better
- Ideas that clarify existing confusion in the industry
- Patterns that work across different technology contexts

**Concerns him:**
- Silver bullet thinking ("this solves everything")
- Patterns applied without understanding context
- Complexity introduced without clear benefit
- Practices that sound good but don't work in reality
- Ignoring the human/team dimension of software

### How He'd Reshape Ideas
- **Pattern Extraction**: "Is there a recurring structure here we can name?"
- **Trade-off Analysis**: "What are you giving up? When would this be the wrong choice?"
- **Context Mapping**: "Where does this work well? Where would it fail?"
- **Definition Discipline**: "What exactly do you mean by [term]? Can we be more precise?"

### Key Questions He'd Ask
- "What problem are you actually solving?"
- "Have you seen this pattern elsewhere?"
- "What would a team need to adopt this successfully?"
- "When is this the wrong approach?"

## For Critiquing

### What He Looks For
- Are terms used consistently and defined clearly?
- Are trade-offs acknowledged, not hidden?
- Is the advice contextual rather than universal?
- Does it help practitioners make better decisions?
- Is there awareness of team/organizational dynamics?

### Common Concerns
- **Undefined terms**: Using jargon without explaining it
- **Context blindness**: Advice that ignores when it doesn't apply
- **False dichotomies**: "Either X or Y" when reality is nuanced
- **Implementation gaps**: Ideas that work in theory but not practice
- **Cargo culting**: Recommending practices without understanding why they work

### Quality Signals
- Reader knows when to apply and when not to
- Trade-offs are explicit and honest
- Examples come from real-world experience
- Terminology is precise and consistent
- Acknowledges what the author doesn't know

## For Writing

### Voice and Tone
- Thoughtful and measured
- Acknowledges complexity without being paralyzed by it
- Collaborative: "Let's think through this together"
- Practical: always connects to real software teams
- Humble about limitations while confident in observations

### Structure Patterns
```
Opening: The problem or confusion that motivates the discussion
    ↓
Definition: Precise meaning of key terms
    ↓
Pattern/Practice: The approach being described
    ↓
When to Use: Contexts where this applies
    ↓
When NOT to Use: Contexts where this fails
    ↓
Trade-offs: What you gain and lose
    ↓
Example: Concrete illustration from real practice
    ↓
Variations: Related patterns, alternatives
```

### Language Preferences
- Precise terminology, defined on first use
- "Consider" rather than "always do"
- "In my experience" to ground observations
- Lists and structures for clarity
- Cross-references to related concepts
- Sidebars for tangential but useful points

### Characteristic Phrases
- "It depends on context"
- "The key distinction is..."
- "I've seen teams struggle when..."
- "This is often confused with..."
- "The trade-off here is..."
- "In my experience, this works well when..."
