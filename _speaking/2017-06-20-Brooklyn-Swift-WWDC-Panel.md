WWDC this year was very exciting. Lots of new developments have come out.

Brooklyn Swift hosted a panel discussion with local Swift developers, experts in different areas impacted by the latest updates.

There is such a strong iOS community in NYC.. great questions from the audience and the panelists were super informative. It was great guiding a discussion keeping in mind to spend the right amount of time on each topic and the right balance of follow-up questions.
