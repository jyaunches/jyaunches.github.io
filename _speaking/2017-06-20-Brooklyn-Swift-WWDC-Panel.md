WWDC this year was very exciting! Lots of new developments have come out.

Brooklyn Swift hosted a panel discussion with local Swift developers, experts in different areas impacted by the latest updates.

Moderating this panel was really awesome! We have such a strong community in NYC.. great questions from the audience and panelists were super informative. It was really awesome guiding a discussion keeping in mind to spend the right amount of time on each topic and the right balance of follow-up questions.
