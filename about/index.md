Hi there. To summarize, I'm a totally lover of making things. That includes building awesome/beautiful software. But the maker vibe goes beyond software to carpentry, cooking and gardening.

My dog is pretty cool. She's a hound mix that loves to go hiking with me and is approaching professional levels in her ball fetching practice. It's really quite impressive.

Originally hailing from the midwest of the United States, over the past 10 years, I've lived and worked across 4 continents. I now find myself back in the US.
