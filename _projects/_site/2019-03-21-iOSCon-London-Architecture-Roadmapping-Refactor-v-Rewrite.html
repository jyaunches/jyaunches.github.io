<p>Apple’s iOS development platform was released over 10 years ago. Since then, significant changes have been made to the toolset and languages surrounding iOS app development. When a development platform reaches this age it is increasingly frequent that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>iOS engineers will encounter ‘legacy’ iOS apps (apps where the majority of architecture was built with outdated language, APIs and toolset references).</li>
  <li>When encountering such apps, the challenges of working within the constraints imposed will be greater.</li>
  <li>There will be a need to evaluate the value of continuing development of such a legacy app versus alternatives such as a rewrite.</li>
</ul>
